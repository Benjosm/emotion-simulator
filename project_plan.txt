EMOTION SIMULATOR - PROJECT PLAN

1. PURPOSE
- Simulate real-time emotional responses based on short-term memory and context
- Enable "what-if" exploration for writers, designers, educators
- Immediate feedback with no configuration

2. ARCHITECTURE
- Single-file CLI: agent.py
- State stored entirely in memory (no persistence)
- Emotion Graph: Dict[str, Dict[str, float]] for emotion triggers
- Memory: deque(maxlen=5) for O(1) memory management
- Event Impact Rules: keyword → emotion mapping

3. COMPONENTS
- agent.py: Typer CLI entrypoint
- Emotion Engine: update + propagation logic
- Memory System: short-term buffer with decay
- Heatmap Renderer: CLI-based visual output

4. DATA FLOW
Input Event → Keyword Extraction → Emotion Impact → Memory Store → Propagation → Output

5. EXTENSION POINTS
- Add emotion intensity thresholds
- Introduce random triggers
- Support memory recall (future)
- Export JSON state

6. JUSTIFICATIONS
- No DB: Faster iteration, no setup
- Typer: Auto-help, validation, clean CLI
- Deque: O(1) append/popleft, bounded memory
